# Building a Handwritten Digit Classification System with Raspberry Pi Pico, OV7670 Camera, TFT LCD Display, and Machine Learning

In this project, I'll guide you through the process of creating a handwritten digit classification system using a Raspberry Pi Pico, an OV7670 camera module, a 128x160 TFT LCD display, and machine learning techniques. Please keep in mind that this code is highly experimental, and even after following all the recommended steps in this article, some tinkering may still be necessary to get it to work. So, let's dive in and start exploring!
